      <h2>How trauma can affect brain development in children and teens:</h3>
      <i>Daniel</i>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Physical abuse is one of the most horrible things a child can expierience, but most people dont realize the after effects are not only physical. </li>
        <li>"Abusive head trauma (AHT)—forceful blows to the head or the shaking of an infant’s head (“shaken baby syndrome”)—creates a distinct set of problems for the developing brain."</li>
        <li>Physcal abuse causes just as much mental damage to developing childs brain as it does physical pain. In many cases the mental after effects of physical abuse can cause life long issues. </li>
        <li>"brain development may be compromised and emotional, behavioral, or learning challenges may persist, especially in the absence of targeted and trauma-informed interventions."</li>
        <li>The affter effects of physcal abuse on children are also extremely varied and not always obivous. Its even easier for them to go unoticed when the child is not given a proper mental health intervention.</li>
        <li>Its because of this that children who have suffered from physical abuse require more than just a trip to the hospital in order to get better. The mental after effects of physical abue must be addressed through proper mental health intervention in order to target the issue at its core.</li>

      <h2>Imposter Syndrome:</h3>
      <i>Tomas</i>
      
      <p></p>

      <h4>Problem statement:</h4>
      <p>Imposter Syndrome causes extreme stress, anxiety, and burnout, typically in work or highly academic settings, in students or professors.</p>

      <h4>Need statement:</h4>
      <p>Students need a mentor in school to build a connection with and be able to talk to in order to feel less stressed and feel like they have truly earned their place.</p>

      <h4>Evidence:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>According to an article by Crystal Raypole for healthline which was medically reviewed by Vara Saripalli, people who suffer from imposter syndrome are likely to write of success as luck, and believe that they did not earn their place and are putting up a front to their peers and professors.</li>
        <li>According to the same article, a good way to deal with imposter syndrome is to acknowledge your feelings and share them, which can help them feel less overwhelming</li>
        <li>Furthermore, building connections will help validate your own strengths and you will not have to do everything by yourself</li>
        <li>Building connections will also help you realize you don’t need to compare yourself with others, because everybody has their own strengths and talents, and nobody can do it all</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Game Balance and overall Game Design</h3>
      <i>Ama</i>
      
      <p></p>

      <h3>Reasearch</h3>
      <p>My research topic is game design and balance. Our project will be making a video game, so during that I will be doing research on how to make our game as fair and enjoyable as possible. A few resources i have found so far areas listed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/gamedesigndevelopmenttextbook/chapter/game-balancing/">Article on Game Balance</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/22797/Jaffe_washington_0250E_11528.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y">A whole book on Game Balance and Design.</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Production of our game</h3>
      <p>We have started a bit on our game, and have had a few issues so far but we have fixed most of them.  The main issues have been:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The character didn't have a movement cap, which we were able to implement after many trials and errors</li>
        <li>If you jumped while touching a platform's corner, you would be shot into the sky. This was fixed by editing the hitbox that determained if you were touching a platform to be a small square.</li>
        <li>The game wasn't registering a left-click input to start the attack sequence, which was due to having the if statement in the wrong location. It was a simple ID-10-T error.</li>
      </ul>
