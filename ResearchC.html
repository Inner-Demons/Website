      <h2>How trauma can affect brain development in children and teens:</h3>
      <i>By Daniel</i>
      
      <h4>Problem statement:</h4>
      <p>
        Many students are deeply struggling with mental health due to trauma at a 
        young age and are affected long after the event. Students don't know how harmful the 
        effects of their trauma are nor where to go for help due to a lack of mental health 
        services.
      </p>

      <h4>Need statement:</h4>
      <p>
        Teenagers who suffer from poor mental health need to be informed on how they could 
        be affected and where they can get help in order to take action and minimize the effects 
        of what's happened to them.
      </p>

      <h4>Evidence:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          “The impact of child traumatic stress can last well beyond childhood. In fact, research 
          has shown that child trauma survivors may experience:Learning problems, including lower 
          grades and more suspensions and expulsions. Increased use of health and mental health 
          services. Increase involvement with the child welfare and juvenile justice systems. 
          Long-term health problems (e.g., diabetes and heart disease)” Trauma can cause a 
          multitude of issues that affects teens in their daily life that many people don't 
          even consider. This includes difficulties in their schooling. Despite this, places like 
          schools offer very little in terms of mental health support which leaves students 
          (especially low income students) not knowing where to go.
        </li>
        <li>
          “More than two thirds of children reported at least 1 traumatic event by age 16” It's 
          not like mental health in teens is uncommon either with many having suffered traumatic 
          events before they are even 17. Even if the traumatic event does not cause long term 
          issues it's absurd that mental health for teens is so understaffed when the issue is 
          this widespread.
        </li>
        <li>
          “Potentially traumatic events include: 1. Psychological, physical, or sexual abuse 
          2.Community or school violence 3.Witnessing or experiencing domestic violence 4.National 
          disasters or terrorism 5.Commercial sexual exploitation 6.Sudden or violent loss of a 
          loved one 7.Refugee or war experiences 8.Military family-related stressors (e.g., 
          deployment, parental loss or injury) 9.Physical or sexual assault 10.Neglect 11.Serious 
          accidents or life-threatening illness” Trauma can come from many places and it's 
          important to know that what a teen might consider a normal event could be one that 
          impacts their mental health. Many teens largely assume that many things in their past 
          are not traumatic events and don't realize how their trauma is able to affect them as 
          a result.

      <h2>Imposter Syndrome:</h3>
      <i>By Tomas</i>
      
      <p></p>

      <h4>Problem statement:</h4>
      <p>
        Imposter Syndrome causes extreme stress, anxiety, and burnout, typically in work or highly 
        academic settings, in students or professors.
      </p>

      <h4>Need statement:</h4>
      <p>
        Students need a mentor in school to build a connection with and be able to talk to in 
        order to feel less stressed and feel like they have truly earned their place.
      </p>

      <h4>Evidence:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          According to an article by Crystal Raypole for healthline which was medically 
          reviewed by Vara Saripalli, people who suffer from imposter syndrome are likely 
          to write of success as luck, and believe that they did not earn their place and 
          are putting up a front to their peers and professors.
        </li>
        <li>
          According to the same article, a good way to deal with imposter syndrome is to 
          acknowledge your feelings and share them, which can help them feel less overwhelming
        </li>
        <li>
          Furthermore, building connections will help validate your own strengths and you will 
          not have to do everything by yourself
        </li>
        <li>
          Building connections will also help you realize you don't need to compare yourself 
          with others, because everybody has their own strengths and talents, and nobody can do 
          it all

      <h2>Game Balance and overall Game Design</h3>
      <i>By Ama</i>
      
      <p></p>

      <h3>Reasearch</h3>
      <p>My research topic is game design and balance. Our project will be making a video game, so during that I will be doing research on how to make our game as fair and enjoyable as possible. A few resources i have found so far areas listed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/gamedesigndevelopmenttextbook/chapter/game-balancing/">Article on Game Balance</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/22797/Jaffe_washington_0250E_11528.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y">A whole book on Game Balance and Design.</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Production of our game</h3>
      <p>We have started a bit on our game, and have had a few issues so far but we have fixed most of them.  The main issues have been:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The character didn't have a movement cap, which we were able to implement after many trials and errors</li>
        <li>If you jumped while touching a platform's corner, you would be shot into the sky. This was fixed by editing the hitbox that determained if you were touching a platform to be a small square.</li>
        <li>The game wasn't registering a left-click input to start the attack sequence, which was due to having the if statement in the wrong location. It was a simple ID-10-T error.</li>
      </ul>
