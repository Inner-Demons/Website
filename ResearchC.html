      <h2>Imposter Syndrome:</h3>

      <h4>Problem statement:</h4>
      <p>Imposter Syndrome causes extreme stress, anxiety, and burnout, typically in work or highly academic settings, in students or professors.</p>

      <h4>Need statement:</h4>
      <p>Students need a mentor in school to build a connection with and be able to talk to in order to feel less stressed and feel like they have truly earned their place.</p>

      <h4>Evidence:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>According to an article by Crystal Raypole for healthline which was medically reviewed by Vara Saripalli, people who suffer from imposter syndrome are likely to write of success as luck, and believe that they did not earn their place and are putting up a front to their peers and professors.</li>
        <li>According to the same article, a good way to deal with imposter syndrome is to acknowledge your feelings and share them, which can help them feel less overwhelming</li>
        <li>Furthermore, building connections will help validate your own strengths and you will not have to do everything by yourself</li>
        <li>Building connections will also help you realize you donâ€™t need to compare yourself with others, because everybody has their own strengths and talents, and nobody can do it all</li>
      </ul>
