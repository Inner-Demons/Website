    <p>Physical abuse is one of the most horrible things a child can expierience, but most people dont realize the after effects are not only physical. </p>
    <p>"Abusive head trauma (AHT)—forceful blows to the head or the shaking of an infant’s head (“shaken baby syndrome”)—creates a distinct set of problems for the developing brain."</p>
    <p>Physcal abuse causes just as much mental damage to developing childs brain as it does physical pain. In many cases the mental after effects of physical abuse can cause life long issues. </p>
    <p>"brain development may be compromised and emotional, behavioral, or learning challenges may persist, especially in the absence of targeted and trauma-informed interventions."</p>
    <p>The affter effects of physcal abuse on children are also extremely varied and not always obivous. Its even easier for them to go unoticed when the child is not given a proper mental health intervention.</p>
    <p>Its because of this that children who have suffered from physical abuse require more than just a trip to the hospital in order to get better. The mental after effects of physical abue must be addressed through proper mental health intervention in order to target the issue at its core.</p>
