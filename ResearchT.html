      <h3>Celeste</h3>
      <p>Summary:</p>
      <p id="indent">Celeste is a game about Madeline, a young woman who suffers from lots of self doubt and 
        anxiety who is climbing the Celeste mountain in order to prove that she can. The game was 
        written by Maddy Thorson, who used their own life experiences to direct
        the story of the game. In the game, among other things Madeline has to content with a physical 
        manifestation of her anxiety. They are fighting the whole game, each one sabotaging the other until 
        they end up falling down the mountain, losing all of the progress that Madeline had made. 
        Instead of giving up, Madeline ends up accepting her twin (aptly named "Badeline"), and 
        teaming up they climb up the rest of the mountain together.
      </p>
      <p>Positive impact:</p>
      <p id="indent">Celeste makes the players reflect on the mental illnesses they are seeing in game, and it makes 
        them learn to take better care of themselves. The game teaches techniques to deal with the mental 
        illnesses, and you can see the transition from denial to acceptance in game. The developer of the 
        game also made a big emphasis on not downplaying any of the mental illnesses shown in game, 
        making it so that people would realize that these are real illnesses that happen in real life.
      </p>
      <p>Limitations:</p>
      <p id="indent">The game was made only with the autors own experiences, without consulting any medical 
        experts. This might cause the players to not relate with Madeline, or feel like the game 
        does not accurately portray the feeling that they are having. Furthermore, the game is 
        very difficult, which could put off the players from completing the game if they get stuck.
